            </h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Today, third-party tracking services and passive traffic monitoring are extensively used to gather knowledge about users’ internet activities and interests. Such tracking has significant privacy implications for the end users. This paper presents an overview of the third-party tracking usage. Using measurements, we highlight the current state of the third-party tracking landscape and differences observed across tracking service classes (e.g., advertising, analytics, and content), across domain categories (e.g., popular vs. less popular, and national vs. global domains), and with regards to the organizations that owns many of the tracker services, when using HTTP and HTTPS, respectively. Understanding these differences help answer questions related to the third-party services that track modern web users and their coverage of our browsing.

                The thesis <em>Swedes Online: You Are More Tracked Than You Think.</em> (<a href="https://files.joelpurra.com/projects/masters-thesis/documents/v1.0.0/joel-purra_masters-thesis_2015-04-23T1353Z_v1.0.0_report.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="https://joelpurra.github.io/masters-thesis-presentation/">slides</a>) was presented (2015-02-19, Linköping, Sweden) in front of the thesis supervisor, the thesis opponent, and an audience of interested students.

                Abstract
            </h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    When you are browsing websites, third-party resources record your online habits; such <em>tracking</em> can be considered an invasion of privacy. It was previously unknown how many third-party resources, trackers and tracker companies are present in the different classes of websites chosen: globally popular websites, random samples of .se/.dk/.com/.net domains and curated lists of websites of public interest in Sweden. The in-browser HTTP/HTTPS traffic was recorded while downloading over 150,000 websites, allowing comparison of HTTPS adaption and third-party tracking within and across the different classes of websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data shows that known third-party resources including known trackers are present on <em>over 90%</em> of most classes, that third-party hosted <em>content</em> such as video, scripts and fonts make up a large portion of the known trackers seen on a typical website and that tracking is just as prevalent on <em>secure</em> as insecure sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Observations include that Google is the most widespread tracker organization <em>by far</em>, that content is being served by known trackers may suggest that trackers are moving to providing services to the end user to <em>avoid being blocked</em> by privacy tools and ad blockers, and that the small difference in tracking between using HTTP and HTTPS connections may suggest that users are given a <em>false sense of privacy</em> when using HTTPS.

Abstract = {When you are browsing websites, third-party resources record your online habits; such tracking can be considered an invasion of privacy. It was previously unknown how many third-party resources, trackers and tracker companies are present in the different classes of websites chosen: globally popular websites, random samples of .se/.dk/.com/.net domains and curated lists of websites of public interest in Sweden. The in-browser HTTP/HTTPS traffic was recorded while downloading over 150,000 websites, allowing comparison of HTTPS adaption and third-party tracking within and across the different classes of websites.

The data shows that known third-party resources including known trackers are present on over 90% of most classes, that third-party hosted content such as video, scripts and fonts make up a large portion of the known trackers seen on a typical website and that tracking is just as prevalent on secure as insecure sites.

Observations include that Google is the most widespread tracker organization by far, that content is being served by known trackers may suggest that trackers are moving to providing services to the end user to avoid being blocked by privacy tools and ad blockers, and that the small difference in tracking between using HTTP and HTTPS connections may suggest that users are given a false sense of privacy when using HTTPS.},

AB  - When you are browsing websites, third-party resources record your online habits; such tracking can be considered an invasion of privacy. It was previously unknown how many third-party resources, trackers and tracker companies are present in the different classes of websites chosen: globally popular websites, random samples of .se/.dk/.com/.net domains and curated lists of websites of public interest in Sweden.
